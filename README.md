Learning Management System targeted at 5th-8th grades.  

Digital and "blended" learning is becoming more and more prevalent as more educational institutions embrace the "inverted classroom" model or a blended approach to curriculum. Allowing students to have access to lecture videos, notes, and checkpoints outside of the classroom frees up class time for answering questions and doing projects. However, most existing LMS programs are built on aging technologies and are not very user-friendly or open-source.  

_Mastery_ is a Learning Management System aimed at intermediate to middle schools.  

### Goals: 
1. Create a platform for middle school educators to manage and deliver curriculum online.
1. Create a welcoming user experience where educators and students can easily find what they need and interact with the curriculum, not the tool. 

### Next steps:  

1. Implement front-end routing, either using a library or a scratch solution. 
1. Flesh out student view; allow student to easily see what units are next, what their recent scores are, and feedback on recent projects/assignments.
1. Student record keeping
